  Personal Website

## Intro

The purpose of this website is twofold:

1. Build a site which includes info about me and allows people to get to know me a little better than through my LinkedIn page while showcasing future projects and blogs where I keep my thoughts organized.
2. Get some familiarity back with tech stacks that I haven't used for some years as well as learn them in a little more depth. I took this chance to get familiar with Gatsby since I've not used it before.


I plan to make a Gatsby starter out of this in the future, but will wait until I'm satisfied with the state of it (including more automation and ease of use) before making one.
